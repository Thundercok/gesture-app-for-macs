## WP1 — Passive "flight recorder" + misfire hotkey — 2026-10-12
- Status: DONE
- Commit: (pending)
- What changed:
  - Created `Tracking/IncidentRecorder.swift` with lock-protected 4.0s ring buffer (240 frames @ 60 FPS) and storage cap enforcement (200 MB).
  - Factored out `makeFrameRecord(...)` in `DatasetRecorder.swift` to share schema across recorders.
  - Added global & local keyboard hotkeys for ⌃⌥⌘M (`.misfire` + Basso sound) and ⌃⌥⌘N (`.missed`).
  - Added menu bar items for marking misfires, marking missed gestures, and toggling passive recording.
  - Wired auto-fire dumping (2.0s pre + 1.0s post) and 10-minute quiet baseline snapshots.
  - Documented incident format in `docs/gesture/INCIDENTS.md`.
  - Extended `tools/eval_gestures.py` with `--incidents` mode, calculating counts, misfire rate, and 95% Wilson score confidence interval.
  - Added 4 unit tests in `tools/test_eval_gestures.py` covering header skipping, Wilson score intervals, and misfire calculations.
- Verification:
  - `swift build`: clean in 13.29s (0 errors, 0 warnings).
  - `python3 -m unittest tools/test_eval_gestures.py -v`: 12/12 passed in 0.090s.
  - `python3 tools/eval_gestures.py --incidents ~/Library/Application\ Support/GestureFlow/incidents`: clean exit 0 on empty directory.
- Open issues: none
